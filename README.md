```

## Motivation
I had troubles with helping my 85 year old mother keep track of what bills she paid and what bills she 'forgot' to pay. This was my solution.

## Installation
Very basic PHP Apache Server, LAMP style install:
* create a database or just add the 13 tables to an existing MySQL database
   * the sql table is in the `inc` directory; file named `tsw-monthly.sql`
* add files where needed into directory structure
* add settings in file `inc/functions.php` and connection credentials in `inc/dbh.php`
* send donation to Larry... lol :-)

## Usage
* Open a month from menu and add new account information using the "update" button [+]
* Note that the update button column will not print.
* Each month table (spreadsheet) can be printed out using browser print
* Do not forget to log out.
* (login default is in inc/functions.php file) remeber this is open source so change default in PHPMyAdmin and set to MD5 dropdown for password field.

## TO DO
* instatiate spl register for require or includes
* faster return to page after edit... link-less
